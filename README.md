## 🧩 Problem Solving

I consistently work on improving my **algorithmic thinking** and **logic building** through practice and real-world debugging scenarios.

I focus on:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Time & Space Complexity Optimization**
- **Clean Code & Efficient Debugging**

> I believe solving problems makes you a **better developer** than just writing code.
